# [Launch JupyterLab in the Cloud](https://yc14e.github.io/jupyterlab-launcher)

While Binder supports JupyterLab, [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) only generates links to open repositories in the classic Jupyter Notebook interface. Through this website you can launch a JupyterLab session in the cloud and pull source from any GitHub repo into the workspace. 

# [Jupyter Notebook to PDF Converter](https://yc14e.github.io/nb2pdf)

Many platforms such as CoCalc, Code Ocean, and Google Colab, let you edit Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, but, to my best knowledge, at the time of this writing, no platform lets you edit Jupyter notebooks and compile them into PDF files (if you know of one please [let me know](https://github.com/yc14e/yc14e.github.io/issues)). I build this web app to fill the gap. 

Binder lets you edit Jupyter notebooks and export compiled PDF, but only if you know how to set it up. Good news is I've done that for you. Just check out the above JupyterLab Launcher.
