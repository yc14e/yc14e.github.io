Each of the following is also an open-source project. Welcome to check out [my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/yc14e?tab=repositories). 


## [Launch JupyterLab in the Cloud](https://yc14e.github.io/jupyterlab-launcher)

Open any GitHub repositories in a ready-to-code JupyterLab workspace in the cloud! Yes, even a private one.

While Binder supports JupyterLab, [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) only generates links to open public repositories in the classic Jupyter Notebook interface. This app is to fill the gap. 


## [Jupyter Notebook to PDF Converter](https://yc14e.github.io/nb2pdf)

You will be surprised to learn this is the first web app to compile Jupyter notebooks into PDF files through LaTeX. 

Many platforms like CoCalc and Google Colab let you edit Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, but, to my best knowledge, at the time of this writing, no platform also lets you export compiled PDF files, except Binder (if you know of one please [let me know](https://github.com/yc14e/yc14e.github.io/issues)). Binder is an option but only if you know how to set it up. Good news is I've done that for you. Just edit locally or on the platform of your choice and convert to PDF using this app, or simply check out the JupyterLab Launcher above. 

I only host this app on Binder so it may take a few seconds to launch. 


## [QuantCalc Financial Math Calculators](https://yc14e.github.io/quantcalc-net)

Online calculators pricing and hedging financial derivatives in various asset classes. This website had 70,000+
cumulative hits before its migration to GitHub Pages. This is purely static, implemented in JavaScript.
