Each of the following is in a separate repository. Welcome to check out [my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/yc14e?tab=repositories). 


## [Launch JupyterLab in the Cloud](https://yc14e.github.io/jupyterlab-launcher)

Open any GitHub repositories in a ready-to-code JupyterLab workspace in the cloud! Yes, even a private one.

While Binder supports JupyterLab, [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) only generates links to open public repositories in the classic Jupyter Notebook interface. This app is to fill the gap. 


## [Jupyter Notebook to PDF Converter](https://yc14e.github.io/nb2pdf)

You will be surprised to learn this is the first web app to compile Jupyter notebooks into PDF files through LaTeX. 

In many cloud platforms you can edit Jupyter notebooks but you can't export them as PDF files. If you are used to one of those platforms, this app is right for you. For now I only host this app on Binder and sometimes it might take a minute to launch. 


## [QuantCalc Financial Math Calculators](https://yc14e.github.io/quantcalc-net)

Online calculators pricing and hedging financial derivatives in various asset classes. This website had 70,000+
cumulative hits before its migration to GitHub Pages. This is purely static, implemented in JavaScript. 


## [The PyMinimax Python Package](https://pyminimax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

PyMinimax is a Python implementation of minimax linkage hierarchical clustering, a powerful modern clustering algorithm that is not currently available in SciPy nor scikit-learn. Available through `pip install`.
